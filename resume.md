## Experience:
**Developer** | Tyson Foods, Springdale, AR | Nov '21 - Present
- Currently working on developing an intelligent chat interface using LLM and Streamlit, enabling SQL query writing and execution with GCP Big Query client. The chat interface is deployed as a secure website, leveraging GCP's Cloud Run, GCR, load balancer, and Identity-Aware Proxy for authentication. 
<br />
- Developed async Python library for Tyson to read/process BigQuery data, create embeddings, and store them in ChromaDB on GCP CloudRun, with mounted Filestore for high-speed I/O. 
- Established simulation-based workflow across Tyson using Nvidia Omniverse, ROS2, MoveIt2, AWS, and Reinforcement Learning. Conducted feasibility testing of digital twin and performed RL in simulation. 
<br />
- Developed ML models with AWS Sagemaker, MxNET, PyTorch & TensorFlow to evaluate synthetic image detection performance, reducing training time by approximately 50% with techniques like Transfer Learning Twice and Distributed Training while achieving an accuracy of approximately 70%. 
<br />
- Designed a cloud-based pipeline using AWS and Blender-Python for synthetic data generation, utilizing AWS Batch, Lambda, S3, ECR, Python, Blender, Docker, Terraform, and GitLab CI. 
<br />
- Built a comprehensive "Press Release and Frequently Asked Question" (PRFAQ) document, incorporating project requirements, high-level system design diagram, milestones, and Return on Investments (ROIs). 

**Software Application Engineer** | Duke University, Durham, NC | Jan’ 21 – Oct’ 21
- Developed a software application for high-performance Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data-acquisition and processing using Python and Qt designer. 
<br />
- Implemented and maintained Project Management System through Jira and Confluence for documentation and user request management. 
<br />
- Collaborated with stakeholders to define OCT software requirements and assess feasibility. 
<br />
- Contributed to existing projects by resolving bugs, implementing requested features, and delivering thorough documentation using Qt Designer, C++, Jira, and Git. 

**Robotics Research Assistant** | Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ | Jan’20 – Jan’ 21
- Developed an autonomous vehicular robot and accompanying middleware in ROS using C++ to operate the bot in a physical testbed. 
<br />
- Utilized URDF to import the robot into Gazebo for simulation and developed a GUI application using Qt Designer and Python to access camera sensor data. 
<br />
- Leveraged YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model to develop an ML model capable of detecting custom objects for robot navigation, achieving an accuracy of approximately 90%.
