## Experience:
**Senior Software Developer** | Tyson Foods, Springdale, AR | Nov '23 - Present
<ul>
- Leading Tyson's Generative AI initiative. Led the development of a Fast-API backend, assisted with the React frontend, for processing structured and unstructured data through Natural Language queries. Successfully deployed the secure chatbot on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using CloudRun, Load Balancer, and Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP).
- Developed a versatile Python library with a RESTful API server, specializing in agent construction, RAG techniques, Keyword Search, and large language model handling. Actively maintaining and evolving this library to ensure its continuous use in Tyson's LLM applications.
</ul>
**Software Developer** | Tyson Foods, Springdale, AR | Nov '21 - Nov '23
<ul>
- Designed and developed an LLM application utilizing streamlit that interprets natural language queries against structured data, providing real-time visualizations and persistent chat history. This solution streamlines user interaction with PowerBI reports, reducing associated time by over 70%.
- Established a simulation-based workflow at Tyson using Nvidia Omniverse, ROS2, MoveIt2, AWS EC2 & Sagemaker, and Reinforcement Learning. Conducted feasibility testing of digital twin and implemented RL in simulation.
- Developed ML models with AWS Sagemaker evaluating synthetic image detection performance. Achieved a 50% reduction in training time through techniques like Transfer Learning Twice and Distributed Training, achieving an accuracy of approximately 70% across 5 classes, with a max class accuracy of 97%.
- Architected and implemented a cloud-based pipeline for synthetic data generation. Leveraged AWS Batch, AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB, Python, Blender, Docker, Terraform, and CI/CD for streamlined development, enabling faster iteration.
</ul>

**Software Application Engineer** | Duke University, Durham, NC | Jan’ 21 – Oct’ 21
<ul>
- Led the development of a high-performance Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data-acquisition and processing software application using Python and Qt Designer.
- Established and maintained an efficient Project Management System leveraging Jira and Confluence, ensuring seamless documentation and user request management.
- Collaborated with stakeholders to define software requirements for OCT, assessing feasibility and aligning with project goals.
- Enhanced existing projects by resolving bugs, implementing requested features, and delivering comprehensive documentation using Qt Designer, C++, Jira, and Git.
</ul>  

**Robotics Research Assistant** | Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ | Jan’20 – Jan’ 21
<ul>
- Engineered an autonomous vehicular robot and its middleware using ROS and C++ for real-world operation.
- Integrated the robot into Gazebo simulation environment using URDF, concurrently developing a user-friendly GUI with Qt Designer and Python to access camera sensor data.
- Applied YOLOv3 model to create a highly accurate ML model, achieving a 90% detection accuracy for custom objects, enhancing the robot's navigation capabilities.
</ul>
