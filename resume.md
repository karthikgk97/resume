## Experience:
\vspace{-0.2cm}
**Senior Developer** | Tyson Foods, Springdale, AR | Nov '23 - Present
<ul>
- Led the development of a scalable, cloud-based chatbot platform using Python, Node.js, and React, enabling over 30,000 business and plant users at Tyson Foods to streamline data access and analysis, identify trends, analyze plant line performance, and access critical business data.
- Implemented a microservice-based architecture on GCP using Terraform, Cloud Run, GCR, IAP, Cloud Storage, Secrets Manager, VPC and Firestore to ensure high availability and security.
- Developed a modular Python library with RESTful APIs for data processing, semantic search, and LLM integrations, enhancing code reusability and accelerating development cycles.
- Enhanced the React frontend of the internal application to support custom file uploads, enabling advanced data analysis on user-provided files (e.g., Excel spreadsheets). Implemented video rendering functionality for transcoded videos using a custom Bash transcoding script integrated with GitLab CI/CD, automating the preprocessing pipeline for on-demand video processing.
</ul>

**Developer** | Tyson Foods, Springdale, AR | Nov '21 - Nov '23
<ul>
- Engineered an innovative data querying and visualization application, combining Semantic and Keyword search with LLM interaction to interpret natural language queries, resulting in a 70% reduction in user interaction time with PowerBI reports.
- Designed and deployed a simulation-based workflow for digital twin feasibility testing using a combination of Nvidia Omniverse, ROS2, MoveIt2, and AWS Cloud services.
- Developed and deployed ML models on AWS Sagemaker for synthetic image classification, achieving a 97% accuracy for the best-performing class and reducing training time by 50% through Transfer Learning Twice and Distributed Training techniques.
- Architected a cloud-based pipeline for synthetic data generation using AWS (Batch, ECR, Lambda, S3), Python, Blender, Docker, and Terraform, implementing CI/CD for accelerated streamlined development cycles.
</ul>

**Software Application Engineer** | Duke University, Durham, NC | Jan’ 21 – Oct’ 21
<ul>
- Developed a high-performance Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) software for data acquisition and processing, using Python and Qt Designer.
- Established and maintained a project management system using Jira and Confluence, facilitating better documentation and streamlined user request handling.
- Enhanced existing software systems by resolving bugs, implementing requested backlog features, and delivering comprehensive documentation using Qt Designer, C++, Jira, and Git.
</ul>  

**Robotics Research Assistant** | Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ | Jan’20 – Jan’ 21
<ul>
- Developed an autonomous robot control system using ROS and C++, seamlessly integrating with Gazebo for both simulation and real-world testing.
- Designed and implemented an intuitive user interface using Qt Designer and Python for real-time sensor data visualization, enhancing robot control and monitoring capabilities.
- Applied YOLOv3 model to create a highly accurate ML model, achieving a 90% detection accuracy for custom objects, enhancing the robot's navigation capabilities.
</ul>
